# Hey!
My name is Petr Ger≈°l. This is the code for my website. It is actually the second version of my site. It doesn't use any stupid bloated JS frameworks, it's a personal website and a little bit of javascript for simple interactions is enough.

## Why a second version?
I wans't happy with the first version (bad design, lack of standard features), so I redid the whole thing. New design, which is now much more easily changable if needed, new features (search, toc, themes) and more.
