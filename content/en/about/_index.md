Hey! My name, as you might have already guessed, is Petr Ger≈°l. I am a [high school](https://www.cmgp.cz/) student interested in chemistry, music, technology and event organizing.


# Introduction
I don't particularly enjoy school, but I do enjoy learning new things. 

I think I am:
- **open-minded** and ready to change opinions on subjects ranging widely is seriousness if presented with good arguments,
- **self-motivated**, be it complex tasks that can take up hours if not days of my life, or simple short mundane repetitive tasks, I can always find something that interests me,
- **a loner**, I like working alone, in fact, I prefer it. It is sometimes hard for me to work in a team, because I am a natural leader and manager, and I hate when something is being done below my expectations. It seems the team does a better job when I take care of everything myself,
- **communicative, fair, decent, respectful and honest**

# Background

I was born in 2005, so I am technically a [Zoomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z). Not many people would describe me that way, certainly not my family. The [elementary school](https://www.zsmenin.cz/) I went to was full of brutes and imbeciles and that's why I switched to a [Christian grammar school](https://www.cmgp.cz/) when I was 11. No matter how much I might not enjoy going to school, I like how this one works. I met my best friends and the greatest teachers there.

I grew up in the South-Moravia region of the Czech Republic, close to the regional city, Brno. The place where I live is not perfect, but I love it here still.

I am self-taught in most of what I do because a high school can't provide a solid introduction to every important subject. I haven't had a chance to work in my preferred field (which would be chemistry) and only had a few part-time jobs.

See my [bio](/bio/) for more!

# Interests

I'm interested in many things and pour a lot of my time into them.

1. **Chemistry**

I fell in love with chemistry the moment I got it as a subject at school. The school wasn't enough for me, so I **took a course** and studied on my own. To have proof that I am quite good at it, I took the **AP Chemistry** exam and got the highest possible score.

2. **Music**

I played the **flute** when I was younger, all the way in pre-school. My teachers noticed that I couldn't bear my classmates playing or singing out of tune and I had to stop playing my part and cover my ears to prevent me losing my eardrums (am I autistic?). I later switched to **piano** and attended an [elementary school of art](http://zusvarhanicka.cz/). I didn't finish it. I am still contemplating whether that was a good choice, but it did free me to grow as a musician and a composer.

3. **Languages**

You surely know this quote:

{{< quote content="The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." author="Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889 - 1951)" >}}

Well, I do agree with it. This is why I am learning to speak **English** and **French**, **Czech** and **Slovak** are my native languages, and I also learned a little bit of **Latin**. I might want to take up one more language at least in the future, **German** (for reasons that are not publishable) or **Spanish**.

4. **Technology**

I love watching where we're headed with technology and it is my dream to contribute to this way ahead myself. I also like the internet and that is the reason why I'm learning simple web development (no frameworks, just HTML, CSS and JS infused with some handy SSG features). I also write simple programs in Python and Bash to speed up my workflow.

# Values

[Judeo-Christian values](https://dennisprager.com/column/what-are-judeo-christian-values/) are the basis of my value system. I am a Christian and I believe in God. Hence, my values are derived from my religion.

However, my value system is also influenced by the economic system I live in. *Capitalism* influenced me a lot and some of my values go perhaps a little against the Judeo-Christian values mentioned earlier. I believe that there is value in wealth and that accumulating it using practices that are just in the eyes of God is good. I think a career is important (for men at least).

My political views are leaning toward the right. I am a conservative. I do, however, find some positive aspects of social states, like the Czech Republic, with free healthcare and education.

# Purpose of this website

The purpose of this website can be separated into three parts:

1. **Internet independence**

I hate social media. I hate when I am not in control. Having a site like this one just means that I am independent of any regulations of social media and I can do or say whatever I want. I am completely free, the sky is the limit. 

2. **Sharing**

The second main mission of this website is to have a place on the internet, where I could share what I do, what I know, what I think and what I create. Having a social media platform just for me controlled by me. Anything new I want to add or old I want to remove is only a button press away.

3. **Learning**

With a great audience comes great responsibility. I gather that not many people are reading this (for now anyway) but that doesn't matter. Having essentially the whole world be able to see what I am up to gives me great motivation to do things, to create and to learn. By writing this website, I practice not only writing in foreign languages but also the essentials of web development, in the future perhaps even photography and more. Having a website or a collection of websites is a great motivational tool for me.
