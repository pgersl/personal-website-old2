*Taken and translated from a testing report by [JCMM](https://www.jcmm.cz/) conducted in June 2022*

To evaluate the so-called creative personality tuning, Urban's figural test of creative thinking was used. Creativity in this test is represented by numerous aspects (cognitive parts are represented by divergent thinking and general and specific knowledge; personality parts are represented by the focus on a goal, motivation and openness to respecting ambiguity).

The result of the test is in the range of the average (middle 50%, 26/75<sup>th</sup> percentile).
