Welcome to my site. My name, as you might have already guessed, is Petr Ger≈°l. I am a [highschool](https://www.cmgp.cz/) student interested in chemistry, music, technology and event organising.

This is MY website, a place on the internet where [I am in charge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdKZVIGRAKQ&list=PL-p5XmQHB_JRRnoQyjOfioJdDmu87DIJc). I created it to share what I [know](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), think and create.
