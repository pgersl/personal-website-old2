Notice anything different?

My new site has been in the works for over a week now and it's finally time to share it. May I present: [music.pgersl.xyz](https://music.pgersl.xyz). Go check it out! It's also in the sidebar!

# Design

The design of the site employs only three main colors: black, white and gray, and a golden accent. The colors are heavily inspired by the [Brno Philharmonic's](https://filharmonie-brno.cz/en/) website, the combination is gorgeous.

# Functionalities

The site is a little simpler than this one. No search, no theme toggle. I might add search somewhere along the way, but I don't think it's really necessary right now. I wrote my own JavaScript for the audio player on the site. It works perfectly. This also means...

# Purpose

My music is on the site. It's some sort of a hub from which you can go listen to my music on your favorite platforms (coming soon!), go buy my tracks, support me, or read more about my music. Each one of my compositions has an article attached for you to find out more.
