**I am one of them now!**

I have added analytics to my site. Do not be scared, your privacy is my priority.

# How am I tracking you?

I am using [Goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) to do analytics on my websites. It is an open-source web analytics platform, available FOR FREE for *reasonable public usage*. This means it is not created for large businesses and is only made for people like me, creating small website projects.

# What do I collect about you?

Goatcounter is privacy-focused and this means that I do not collect any sensitive data about you. The primary thing that interests me is the **number of unique IP addresses** that request access to my websites. Goatcounter DOES NOT save nor show me your IP address. This number basically tells me how many people visit this website.

Next, I collect a few things about what you are using to access my website. Goatcounter collects data about which browser you are using and what operating system (e.g. Android, Windows, Linux) you use. I am also tracking which device you use, whether it is a phone, a computer or a tablet.

I also collect some information about your location and your language. I DO NOT get access to your precise location, only the country or the region (or state). I also track your language, the language of your device.

# How can you stop me?

Install an adblocker or a privacy-first browser like [Brave](https://brave.com/). You can block any trackers you want and I will not get access to any data. This is totally fine with me and I understand if you don't want to share anything. So do not bother with turning your adblocker or Brave Shields down when you are on one of my sites, it is your data, and you can do whatever you want with it.

# Why am I tracking you?

There is a simple reason why I want to track you. I would like to get a simple idea of how many people actually visit my site and whether my work put into it makes sense or not. It is also interesting to me to see the simplified demographics of my visitors. This is especially important for my multilingual support. If a significant number of my visitors come from France, for example, it would then be only logical to start translating more of the site's content into French. 

The reason therefore is mainly my own interest and the convenience for my visitors.

# Can you get access to these analytics?

I am still contemplating whether to enable anyone to see my analytics since Goatcounter does give me this option. Once I have decided, I will let you know. For now, it will only be available to me.  

That is the latest update on my site. I am working on a longer piece about the tech behind this site and how it all works, so stay tuned!
