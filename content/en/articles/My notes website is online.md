Look to the left, a new button appeared!

Another new site of mine has been in the works for the past few days and is finally online. May I present: [notes.pgersl.xyz](https://notes.pgersl.xyz). Go check it out!

# Design

The design of the site is very minimal, but also user-friendly and easy to navigate. It employs three colors: grey, white, and, depending on whether you use the light or dark theme, blue or orange. With other design features, the website resembles an app rather than a simple website.

# Functionalities

The site is again a little simpler than this one, it has a site-wide search, two themes and a custom site map, for which I wrote my own JavaScript. You can also print any page you want with a push of a button. Everything works exactly to my liking.

# Purpose

The site exists as a place for my notes, a quick reference for me and perhaps a source of information to others. My notes are **not available** right now, but they will be soon enough.

[Enjoy](https://notes.pgersl.xyz/about-my-notes/)!
